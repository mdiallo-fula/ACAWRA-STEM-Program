            The African-Canadian Association of Waterloo Region & Area (ACAWRA)
            strives, with a unified purpose and a single voice, to advocate,
            educate, and promote issues of mutual benefit to people of African
            descent living in the Waterloo Region and surrounding areas. We are
            dedicated to bringing African communities together through capacity
            building and self-empowerment, working to enhance the well-being of
            African descendants in the area.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            In collaboration with other relevant groups, agencies, and the
            broader community, the Association advocates for the acceptance,
            respect, and improved access to community resources for Africans in
            the region. We aim to achieve this through networking, social
            support, raising awareness, and implementing appropriate programs
            and interventions.

            As part of our efforts to empower the African community in the
            region, we are starting a STEM program for students in grades 7-12.
            The aim of the program is to expose students to STEM fields and
            enhance their problem-solving skills through stimulating challenges.
            Students will engage in three types of activities: conceptual,
            virtual, and physical. These activities will come in the form of
            mathematics & physics problems, programming challenges, and Arduino
            (robotics) projects.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            From mathematics problem-solving sessions to hands-on Arduino
            projects, each activity will foster studentsâ€™ conceptual
            problem-solving abilities, encouraging them to think logically and
            deeply about abstract concepts. Programming challenges will allow
            students to bring their ideas to life in a virtual environment,
            giving them the opportunity to design and create through code.
            Meanwhile, the Arduino projects will bring their creativity into the
            physical world. These projects will be highly practical, involving
            the assembly of real electronic components, enabling students to
            build functional prototypes and explore the intersection of coding
            and electronics.
